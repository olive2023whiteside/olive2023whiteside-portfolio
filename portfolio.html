        </div>
      <div id="description"><p>My go at coding was in building a website for a 30MM film project. The film projects was a personal diary from 4 NYUAD students recounting how they feel at the start of school. It was meant to caputre how attitudes and perspectives change from Freshman to Junior year. <br> </br>
        In building a site for this projects, I aimed to create a digital and interactive poster-themed experience. Firsts are daunting and bring a bunch of frusteration, this coding project was no different, but I'm happy to present where I first started.  </p>

        </div>
        <div id="description"><p>This was my first of many group coding projects and it taught me so so much. Space Duck was crafted as comic-inspired and cosmic-placed story about a Duck's journey home. There were many twists in his odd tale which I am proud to present... </p>

        <div id="subhead"><h3>Sounds Like: A Meditation</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="description"><p> Let's get zen! For the sound project, we chose to script and record a meditation. The concept of the audio was to use outdoor water sounds and instrumental music tones to create a full and immersive environment while using slow self-recorded audio as the meditation.
          <br> <br> In building a website to house our project, we chose to draw thematic inspiration from the well established visual and audio iconography of meditation and restorative spa spaces which includes flower imagery and sleek, minimalist design. We were striving to create a relaxing experience which necessitated the creation of a low-distraction, easy-to-use site with strong continuity.  </p>

        <div id="subhead"><h3>VID-E-O: A Vampire Story</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="description"><p> The concept of this project was to create a series of videos that follow the odd story of a student investigation into the sighting of a vampire on campus. We wanted to create a Camp infused video experience that felt spontaneous and student-made. As for the videoâ€™s website, we wanted to hone in on the investigative and performative undertones of the video, finding ways to incorporate both true crime and theater related framing in our interactivity. We hope that all viewers will enjoy the seriousness with which we pursued the absurdity of our project. </p>
