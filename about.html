        </div>
        <p> I am driven to understand the human experience. When I say this I do not mean answering questions like, "what is a good life," although I do enjoy many spirited philosophical conversations. What I mean is an intellectual endeavor in understanding the systems that organize and influence a person, their decisions, and their network. Moreover, I am interested in the social, economic, and political problems faced by people around the world and the context in which they arise.
          <br> <br>
This is a pursuit I have returned to without fail: from papers focused on modern protest in the digital age to multimedia projects created to explore the relation between medium, arena, and reception. As a Freshman studying Media Culture and Communications at NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, I continue to delve into my passion while broadening my horizons. To round out my studies I wish to expand my knowledge of digital campaign creation and brand/policy research.
          <br> <br>
Aside from being creative and diligent in my work, I am also reliable and energetic in the workplace. I am interested in a career within the fields of Consulting, Content Creation, and Research Analysis. These represent intersections of my passions and strengths, and are bound to create change in the communities that I represent and serve.
